# About the game and what it does

The goal of the game is for the user to match that random number by clicking on the crystals. At the start of the game, a random number will generate in its designated box. Every crystal is assigned a number between 1 through 12. The crystal's number will be added to the user's number. If the user's number matches the random number, the user wins the game, and a win will be added to the user's score. If the user's number goes over the random number, the user losses the game, and a loss will be added to the user's score.
